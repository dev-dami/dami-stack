# Throwaway spike
Gate: get the user's OK before committing the spike to its side branch (G2). See gates.md in the skill house-rules.
Job: Answer one design question with cheap running code.
Takes: a question.   Gives: a runnable demo, a verdict, a side branch reference.
Team moves: race (for look questions, when the user wants variants from different kinds)

## Steps

1. **Name the one question and its kind.** The results differ a lot, so decide which it is.

   | Kind | The question | Follow |
   |---|---|---|
   | Logic | Is this state model sound? | `logic-spike.md` |
   | Look | How should this screen work? | `look-spike.md` |

   If it could be either and the user is away, infer the kind from nearby code and state your assumption. If the experiment doesn't belong in this session, use the skill `baton-pass` to move it to a side session, and take the verdict back as a note.

2. **Hold these for either kind:**
   - It sits beside the code it informs and follows the existing routing conventions.
   - It is plainly temporary, by name and on screen.
   - One command or a double-click starts it.
   - State lives in memory, unless persistence is the question. Then use a clearly disposable store.
   - It has no tests, no abstractions and no extra error handling.
   - Full state is visible after every action.

3. **Build it** by the kind's file, and get it running.

4. **Put it in front of someone and watch.** The best signs: someone spots a move the model should refuse, or wants a mix of two variants. Write down the verdict. A spike is a stand-in, so its verdict about the real system is `[simulated]` until real code proves it.

5. **Keep the code.** With OK, commit it to an unmerged side branch. A worker reports this under `Needs OK` and leaves it for the lead.

6. **Move only the decision.** Fold the decision into real code or into the chart, then record the question and the verdict in a note artifact in the bench's `notes/` folder. Reference the side branch from any card that implements the decision. A trimmed snippet may go into a chart when it pins a decision better than prose. If this resolves a `try` card, give the verdict to the skill `work-chart` to post.

## Done when

- One question was stated, with its kind, and any inferred kind was said out loud.
- The spike started from one command or double-click, and showed full state after each action.
- The kind's own Done when is met.
- A verdict answers the question and is recorded with it.
- The code sits on an unmerged side branch committed with OK, or the user declined and that is stated.
- Nothing from the spike reached the main line except the decision, and implementing cards reference the branch.
